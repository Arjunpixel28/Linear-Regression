Life Expectancy Prediction Linear Regression
Overview
This repository contains the code for a simple linear regression model to predict life expectancy based on various factors. The model is trained using historical data and can be used to estimate life expectancy for a given set of input features.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is [insert dataset source here, e.g., World Health Organization (WHO) dataset]. It includes features such as GDP, healthcare expenditure, education level, etc., and the corresponding life expectancy values.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/life-expectancy-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd life-expectancy-prediction
Install the required packages:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preparation:

Ensure you have the dataset in the correct format (CSV, Excel, etc.) and update the data loading code in data_loader.py accordingly.

Training the Model:

Run the training script to train the linear regression model:

Copy code
python train.py
This will save the trained model as a file (e.g., life_expectancy_model.pkl).

Making Predictions:

Use the trained model to make predictions for new data. Modify the input features in the predict.py file and run:

Copy code
python predict.py
This will output the predicted life expectancy based on the input features.

File Descriptions
data_loader.py: Contains functions to load and preprocess the dataset.
train.py: Script to train the linear regression model.
predict.py: Script to make predictions using the trained model.
life_expectancy_model.pkl: Saved trained model file.
