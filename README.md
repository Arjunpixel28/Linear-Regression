# Life Expectancy Linear Regression Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file (`life_expectancy_linear_regression.ipynb`) that demonstrates a simple linear regression model for predicting life expectancy based on certain features. Users can run this notebook to understand the process of preprocessing, loading, training, and evaluating a linear regression model using Python and popular data science libraries.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

git clone git@github.com:Arjunpixel28/Linear-Regression.git
cd life-expectancy-linear-regression


2. **Install dependencies:**


3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**


This will open the Jupyter Notebook in your browser. You can run each cell in the notebook to understand the step-by-step process of preprocessing the data, loading the dataset, training the linear regression model, and evaluating its performance.

## Notebook Contents

- **1. Data Preprocessing:** Exploring and cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- **2. Data Loading:** Loading the preprocessed data into the notebook.
- **3. Model Training:** Splitting the data into training and testing sets, training the linear regression model using Scikit-Learn.
- **4. Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- **5. Conclusion:** Summary of the findings and potential areas of improvement.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about various factors that might influence life expectancy, such as GDP, healthcare expenditure, education, etc. The dataset is available in the `data` folder.
